## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Throughout our time as NBA fans, we have seen the game of basketball and how players play it transform drastically. In the last decade, teams have become much more heavily reliant on the three-point shot and much less on inefficient mid-range shots. The player that has contributed to the rise of the three-point shot the most is Stephen Curry, an electrifying shooter considered by many to be the most excellent shooter and one of the greatest players of all time. While it is evident how talented Stephen Curry is just by watching him, we want to use data to quantify his greatness in our project. We want to compare his statistics, specifically his shooting stats, to other players to show how much of an outlier Curry is. Additionally, we want to track his impact on other players and teams by seeing how much three-point shooting volumes and percentages have changed since Curry joined the league. We also want to see the decrease in the volume of mid-range jump shots.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words
This dataset contains a variety of relevant stats from the NBA and two other related, short-lived leagues dating back to the 1940s. These stats relate to players and teams and cover a variety of data such as per-game stats, season totals, stats standardized per 36 minutes or 100 possessions, and end-of-season awards. Additionally, there are information files that identify players and teams, matching them to their relevant statistics. The data from this set we will focus on for our project are the player totals, player per game, player shooting, player advanced, and team totals. These are the most relevant statistics to our project and will provide us with enough valuable information to conclude.
