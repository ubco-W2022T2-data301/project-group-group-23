## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Through our analytics project, we aim to analyze the impact of Stephen Curry on the game of basketball. Specifically, we want to examine how his playing style has contributed to the rise of three-point shooting and the decline of mid-range shooting in the NBA. By conducting this research, we will quantify Curry’s greatness through data analysis. We also want to show how Curry’s impact on the game has given him a unique place in basketball history.

We are particularly interested in this topic because we are fans of the NBA and have observed the game's evolution over the years. We have seen the impact of Curry’s style of play on the game. Since teams now rely so heavily on data and statistics, we will also have plenty of information to show an analytical summary of Curry’s excellence. This data is also very presentable in a Dashboard, and we believe we can make this data visually appealing and easy to understand.


## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words
This dataset is a comprehensive collection of statistics from the NBA and two related leagues from 1947 to today. We found this dataset on Kaggle, and it sources its statistics from Basketball Reference, a website that provides comprehensive statistics, historical data, and analysis for professional basketball leagues. 

The statistics in our dataset cover players and teams and include a variety of data such as per-game stats, season totals, stats standardized per 36 minutes or 100 possessions, and end-of-season awards. The dataset also provides information files that match players and teams to their relevant statistics. This data is tracked live during NBA games by a group of professional statisticians.

The purpose of our dataset is to provide valuable insights into player and team performance over time. It offers a comprehensive view of a team’s performance over a specific period. Analyzing this data can help the team understand their and their players’ performance and what factors contribute to their success or failure.

The statisticians divide this dataset into many broad categories. For this project, our group will focus on the player totals, player per game, player advanced, and team totals categories.
