## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Throughout our time as NBA fans, we have seen the game of basketball and how players play it transform drastically. In the last decade, teams have become much more heavily reliant on the three-point shot and much less on inefficient mid-range shots. The player that has contributed to the rise of the three-point shot the most is Stephen Curry, an electrifying shooter considered by many to be the most excellent shooter and one of the greatest players of all time. While it is evident how talented Stephen Curry is just by watching him, we want to use data to quantify his greatness in our project. We want to compare his statistics, specifically his shooting stats, to other players to show how much of an outlier Curry is. Additionally, we want to track his impact on other players and teams by seeing how much three-point shooting volumes and percentages have changed since Curry joined the league. We also want to see the decrease in the volume of mid-range jump shots.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words
This dataset is a comprehensive collection of statistics from the NBA and two related leagues from 1947 to today. We found this dataset on Kaggle, and it sources its statistics from Basketball Reference, a website that provides comprehensive statistics, historical data, and analysis for professional basketball leagues. 

The statistics in our dataset cover players and teams and include a variety of data such as per-game stats, season totals, stats standardized per 36 minutes or 100 possessions, and end-of-season awards. The dataset also provides information files that match players and teams to their relevant statistics. This data is tracked live during NBA games by a group of professional statisticians.

The purpose of our dataset is to provide valuable insights into player and team performance over time. It offers a comprehensive view of a team’s performance over a specific period. Analyzing this data can help the team understand their and their players’ performance and what factors contribute to their success or failure.

The statisticians divide this dataset into many broad categories. For this project, our group will focus on the player totals, player per game, player advanced, and team totals categories.
