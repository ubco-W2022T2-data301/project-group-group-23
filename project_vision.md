# Project Vision

Our project vision is to showcase how the NBA has changed over the years. Since its inception, the NBA has transformed from a league dominated by shots close to the basket to a distance-shooting driven league. We can demonstarted this by showing the dominance of Stephen Curry, the rise of the three-point shot, and the decline of the mid-range shot.
