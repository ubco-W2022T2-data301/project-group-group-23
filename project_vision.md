# Project Vision

Our project vision is to see how genuinely talented Stephen Curry is. We can compare his statistics, particularly his scoring and shooting statistics, to other players. Additionally, we can see how he has changed the game by showing how mid-range shots have become less prevalent and three-point shots have become more prevalent.

## Contracted Grade

For this project, we agree to contract for a { A+}.
