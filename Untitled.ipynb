    "My research goal is to analyze Stephen Curry's offensive skills, particularly his incredible three-point shooting, to show why he is one of the greatest basketball players of all time.

    "This graph shows that three-point percentage has increased from around 25% in the early 1980s to around 35% today.

You can find the full analysis [here](https://github.com/ubco-W2022T2-data301/project-group-group-23/blob/main/analysis/analysis1.ipynb) if you are interested in reading a more in depth anaylsis of Stephen Curry ability. \n"
