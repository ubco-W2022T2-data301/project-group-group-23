    "Through this data analysis, we aim to demonstrate the exceptional ability of Stephen Curry and establish his status as the greatest three-point shooter in the history of the sport. To see how good Stephen curry is by comparing his stats with other great three-point shooters such as Ray Allen, Reggie Miller, and Klay Thompson. By doing so, I hope to gain a more comprehensive comprehension of his exceptional abilities and present a thorough, yet succinct, assessment of his overall on-court impact. Throughout this analysis, I will prioritize offering an impartial and objective evaluation of Stephen Curry's skills, while also endeavouring to highlight his distinctive strengths to a wider audience."
